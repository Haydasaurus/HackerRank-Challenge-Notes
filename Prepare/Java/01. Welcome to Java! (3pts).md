Welcome to the world of Java! In this challenge, we practice printing to stdout.

The code stubs in your editor declare a _Solution_ class and a _main_ method. Complete the _main_ method by copying the two lines of code below and pasting them inside the body of your _main_ method.

```java
System.out.println("Hello, World.");
System.out.println("Hello, Java.");
```
