In this challenge, you must read an _integer_, a _double_, and a _String_ from stdin, then print the values according to the instructions in the _Output Format_ section below. To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor.

**Note:** We recommend completing [Java Stdin and Stdout I](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-stdin-and-stdout-1) before attempting this challenge.

**Input Format**

There are three lines of input:

1.  The first line contains an _integer_.
2.  The second line contains a _double_.
3.  The third line contains a _String_.

**Output Format**

There are three lines of output:

1.  On the first line, print `String:` followed by the unaltered _String_ read from stdin.
2.  On the second line, print `Double:` followed by the unaltered _double_ read from stdin.
3.  On the third line, print `Int:` followed by the unaltered _integer_ read from stdin.

To make the problem easier, a portion of the code is already provided in the editor.

**Note:** If you use the _nextLine()_ method immediately following the _nextInt()_ method, recall that _nextInt()_ reads integer tokens; because of this, the last newline character for that line of integer input is still queued in the input buffer and the next _nextLine()_ will be reading the remainder of the integer line (which is empty).

**Sample Input**

```
42
3.1415
Welcome to HackerRank's Java tutorials!
```

**Sample Output**

```
String: Welcome to HackerRank's Java tutorials!
Double: 3.1415
Int: 42
```

Starter Code
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = scan.nextInt();

        // Write your code here.

        System.out.println("String: " + s);
        System.out.println("Double: " + d);
        System.out.println("Int: " + i);
    }
}
```

Finished Code
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = scan.nextInt();
        
        Double d = scan.nextDouble();
        scan.nextLine();
        String s = scan.nextLine();

        System.out.println("String: " + s);
        System.out.println("Double: " + d);
        System.out.println("Int: " + i);
    }
